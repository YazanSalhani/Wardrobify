## Shoes microservice

In the shoes microservice I have two models. The BinVO model as well as a Shoes model. The BinVO model is used to reach out to the bin model in the wardrobe microservice and return the specific ids of the bins that are there. Those bin ids are given in the Shoes model. The shoes model also presents the name of the manufacturer, the model name, color and a picture url.


## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
